<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>
<p>In recent years, streaming services have become prevalent in the modern age of technology.  <br>
No longer are people redeeming their iTunes gift cards to own full length albums and no longer are people paying a dollar a pop for songs. With the ability to purchase a membership to a streaming service and listen to any music on demand, the business of music has surely been turned upside-down.</p>

<p>Just how exactly has the music industry been affected by the rise of these streaming giants? Both negative and positive affects have been cited. The negativity surrounding online streaming stemmed from those involved in the sale of physical media. Big record label executives who were dependent on CD sales were devastated by such a revolution in the music industry. It put many out of jobs.</p>

<p>While record label executives saw an unwelcome change in their industry, Artists on the other hand saw an increase in both exposure and potential for revenue. While sales of physical media were way down, artists were able to reach a much wider audience via the online streaming platforms. </p>
<p>In 2018, album sales fell 18 percent over 2017 and individual song sales fell a whopping 29 percent over the previous year. Unsurprisingly, online streaming was up 42 percent since last year. It's clear how the music industry is changing, and its even more clear that consumers are no longer interested in owning media when they can pay a subscription fee to stream it as often as they want. </p>
